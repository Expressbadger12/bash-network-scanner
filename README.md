## Overview
A bash script to scan for network vulnerabilities

## Requirements
Requires nmap, jq, and curl to run.

## Disclaimer


The scanner does not work completely yet, but it performs an nmap scan and displays the open ports. It does not yet look through the CVE list. 

The future goal is to make the program find the active CVEs on the network and report them.
